# Machine Learning
Source code of the Machine Learning model for the GROWTHY Application to detect ornamental plant information and classify ornamental plant diseases.

The machine learning part of the Application consists of 2 main models:

- Ornamental plant classification model to detect types of ornamental plants in real time and classify them based on plant photos.
- Ornamental plant disease classification model to detect types of diseases that attack ornamental plants and classify them based on the diseases in the dataset.

## Dataset

- [Plant Species Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nBNTiMhPGavQEQ95O52bjjo3tGJcCvHI?usp=sharing)

## Tasks
- Week 1: Data gathering and pre-processing.
- Week 2 & 3: Data training.
- Weeek 4: Model evaluation and optimization.
- Week 5: Model deployment.
