# Machine Learning
The Machine Learning team's job is to learn and create machine learning models for the GROWTHY Application, specifically for classifying ornamental plant information and detecting ornamental plant diseases.

The machine learning part of the application consists of two main models:
1. [Ornamental plant classification model](https://github.com/Capstone-Projecto/main-growthy/blob/machine-learning/notebook/Notebook_Klasifikasi_Tanaman_Hias.ipynb): This model detects different types of ornamental plants in real time and classifies them based on plant photos.
2. [Ornamental plant disease classification model](https://github.com/Capstone-Projecto/main-growthy/blob/machine-learning/notebook/OPlant_Disease_e30%20(1).ipynb): This model detects various types of diseases that attack ornamental plants and classifies them based on the diseases in the dataset.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate the models, the team uses the following datasets:
1. [Plant Species Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nBNTiMhPGavQEQ95O52bjjo3tGJcCvHI?usp=sharing): This dataset contains images of different ornamental plant species. 
2. [Plant Disease Dataset](https://s.id/1MFQI): This dataset consists of images representing different diseases that can affect ornamental plants.

## Tasks
The team follows a structured workflow with specific tasks for each week:
- Week 1: Data gathering and pre-processing. The team collects and prepares the necessary data, ensuring it is in a suitable format for training the models.
- Weeks 2 & 3: Data training. The team trains the machine learning models using the prepared datasets.
- Week 4: Model evaluation and optimization. The team evaluates the performance of the trained models, identifies areas for improvement, and optimizes the models accordingly.
- Week 5: Model deployment. The team finalizes the models and prepares them for deployment in the GROWTHY Application.
